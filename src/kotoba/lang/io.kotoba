  "Reader/Writer streaming abstraction for the kotoba foundational stdlib.
  Layer 3 (I/O).

  A capability-confined cell does not get a socket or file descriptor — the host
  grants a reader/writer handle. This namespace defines the protocols and the
  pure byte-buffer / copy glue; the host (or fs/http protocol impls) supplies
  the endpoints.

  Zero third-party runtime deps; .cljc (JVM / SCI / CLJS / GraalVM / kotoba-WASM)."
